# APMC_project
The purpose of the “APMC” project is that we are going to link the farmers and whole sellers using the database management software. Here the “APMC” is managed by the admin who gives a platform for both the farmers and sellers to interact with each other efficiently. The main problem in the present world is that there is no online database to store information permanently for the market transactions. So we are going to create a dynamic online website which solves the transaction problem. Here we are collecting information about the produced goods , requirement by sellers and is will be managed by the admin efficiently. The outcome of this project is that the farmer will be obtaining the maximum profit for his products and the seller can buy the products at minimal cost.
